NutScript was created by Chessnut and Black Tea as a DRM-free and open source roleplaying framework. Currently, it is being maintained by the NutScript Community.

To fully use NutScript, you need the framework and a schema.

### Frameworks

There are currently 3 versions of the NutScript framework available:

1. [NutScript 1.2](https://github.com/NutScript/NutScript)
    - The latest and currently maintained version of NutScript. It is highly recommended to use this version.
2. [NutScript 1.1](https://github.com/rebel1324/NutScript)
    - The previous version of NutScript. While it is functional and numerous schemas and plugins exist for it, it is no longer maintained.
3. [NutScript 1.0](https://github.com/Chessnut/NutScript/tree/1.0)
    - Legacy, original version of NutScript. It is not recommended to use this version.

There also exists the [NutScript 1.1-beta](https://github.com/rebel1324/NutScript/tree/1.1-beta) version, however, it is simply Version 1.2 in early stages of development. As such, any plugin that is made for 1.1-beta is fully compatible with 1.2 (but not 1.1 or 1.0).

### Schemas

It is highly recommended to create your own schema, as you will have full control and understanding of what the schema does. To do so, it is recommended to download the [skeleton schema](https://github.com/NutScript/skeleton-schema) and start from there.

However, there are also numerous premade schemas that publicly exist, and you can use them as a reference.

1. [Respite by Chancerawr](https://github.com/Chancerawr/respite)
2. [Metro 2033 by ts-co/Pilot](https://github.com/ts-co/Metro-2033)

### Editors

If you do not have one already, it is highly recommended to use an editor to develop your code. A few recommended editors are:

1. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

Once you have both the framework and schema downloaded, head over to [Installing the Framework/Schema.](Installing%20the%20Framework%20and%20Schema.md)
